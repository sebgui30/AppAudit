# App Audit
App Audit is a Python desktop application that helps users track lifetime usage for applications that they choose. The goal is to provide clear insights into how much time is spent on specific selected programs, making it easier to manage productivity, digital wellness, or recognize and record usage patterns for personal use. This project was initially started as a university student personal project. This project is not for academic or commercial purposes.

## Purpose
Many operating systems only have session-based application usage tracking rather than lifetime usage tracking. App Audit is designed to:
- Monitor selected applications continuously over time.
- Consistently manage and restore usage data locally.
- Provide a simple and pleasing interface to users that enables them add, remove, and track usage with ease.
- Allow the simple exporting and visualization of collected data.

## Features
- Track usage time of selected apps
- Save data locally (no internet connection required)
- Simple GUI for managing tracked apps
- Usage statistics (planned)
